    // a scalar type represents a single value and Rust has four primary scalar types: int, bool, float, char

    // integers can be signed or unsigned (doesn't need a sign because iit is obly ever positive) which decides whetehr it can be negative or not

    // integer overflow happens when try to asign an integer a value outside of its range i.e let in: i8 = 258;
    // would cause the compiler to panic, you can change this setting with wrappers which will subtract the maximum value of the type from the assigned value

    // floating points are variables capable of holding decimal numbers
    // there are two flaot types f64 (default) and f32 both are about the same speedwise on modern cpu's while f64 is more precise being 64 bits instead of 32
